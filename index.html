            <h2>The Menace Stands in Solidarity with our Siblings across the Pond</h2>
            <p> JK Rowling has dedicated her immense power, influence, and wealth to the destruction of trans people, and specifically trans women, across the United Kingdom. 
                She donated £70,000 to For Women Scotland, a transphobic orginaztion dedicated to the criminilization of trans lives and bodies.
                <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8q55d27lgo">On Wednesday, April 16th the UK Supreme Court ruled in their favor</a>, defining “women” in a way that excludes trans women—even trans women who have gone through the process of legally changing their sex and obtaining a Gender Recognition Certificate.
                Trans people will now be excluded from public facilities such as bathrooms and changing rooms. This change subjects trans people, particularly trans women, to an even greater risk of violence and harassment. 
                <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/04/17/jk-rowling-terf-ve-day-supreme-court-ruling-for-women-scotland/"> JK Rowling celebrated this decision by posting a selfie on X of her on her yacht, drinking and smoking a cigar.</a> </p>
            <p> Baroness Falkner, chair of the UK Equality and Human Rights Commission, has suggested that trans people should use our “power of advocacy”  <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8q55d27lgo">to ask for “third space” bathrooms to be built just for us</a>, as if it’s realistic to get every business and public building in the UK to undertake a construction project in order for us to pee.
                Instead, we choose to assert what we already know to be true: trans women are women. Trans men are men. Trans rights are human rights. Trans people deserve to exist in public, we deserve to live openly, freely, and with dignity. We will not stop fighting until we get what we deserve. </p>
